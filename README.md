## Project Overview – Mental Health Dashboard

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that examines global mental-health survey data to uncover demographic patterns, common disorders, and underlying causes.
Using anonymized responses, the dashboard enables users to:

Profile mental-health prevalence by gender and age group to identify at-risk populations.

Measure disorder distribution across conditions such as depression, burnout, anxiety, OCD, and more.

Analyze root causes—including trauma, substance use, and social or financial pressures—that contribute to mental-health challenges.

Filter by country/region to compare trends across multiple locations.

The visualization helps stakeholders such as health agencies, HR teams, and policy makers quickly pinpoint priority areas for intervention and design evidence-based support programs.

Tools & Skills Demonstrated:
Power BI • Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)• Data Visualization & Storytelling
